                <p>The objective of The Harvard
                Crimson&rsquo;s Journalism
                Awards program is to recognize superb
                journalism produced at the high school
                level. We will be taking entries from
                nearly all aspects of journalism, with
                categories including general news,
                features, sports and arts, opinion, and
                overall reporter, along with multimedia
                such as photo, video, and newspaper design.
                Given the rise of digital journalism,
