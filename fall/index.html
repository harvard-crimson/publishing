            <h2>About the Conference</h2>
            <p>The conference is a one-day event for high school journalists with all levels of experience. Participants will attend seminars on different aspects of journalism led by our editors and executives, panels on how to incorporate journalism experiences into college applications, as well as attend a keynote speech by an accomplished journalist followed by a Q&amp;A session. Faculty advisors will also have a chance to tour the building and participate in a roundtable discussion. The conference provides participants with the opportunity to learn from and interact with experienced college journalists in a fun, collegiate setting. By working with our editors as well as fellow attendees, all participants will improve their skills and strengthen their interest in journalism, coming up with new ideas that they can then implement in their own papers. We look forward to meeting you!</p>

            <p>Our fall conference will revolve around the fundamentals of journalism and traditional reporting, with a strong emphasis on specific writing techniques that high-school journalists can implement. Seminars will delve deeply into how to report on stories frequently covered by high school newspapers. The conference will strengthen skills in all aspects of newspaper writing, from editorial columns to sports stories and arts reviews. Content will focus on intricacies like effectively using sentence structure, organizing and conducting interviews, developing good source relationships, editing, proofreading, research, and in-depth storytelling. The conference will be held on October 10th; the finalized list of seminars will be available by the end of the spring semester right here.</p>
