            <h2>About our Programs</h2>
            <p>It is our privilege to invite you to participate in our range of programming for high school students, which kicks off with our annual journalism conference on Saturday, April 1.</p>
            <p>Led by some of our most talented and dedicated staff, the conference is a chance for students to work and learn alongside editors at The Crimson. Seminars hosted by our nine boards give students a hands-on chance to learn about the practices, standards, and techniques that drive our organization.</p>
            <p>Finally, The Crimson&rsquo;s Summer Journalism Academy is a chance for an experience as educational and exciting as our journalism conference, but spanning a week during the summer, and thus far more immersive, instructive, and fun. Crimson staffers will work with students on various journalism-related skills, teach participants about the workings of a bustling daily newspaper, and attendees will even print a paper of their own at the end of the week.</p>
            <p>We hope we&rsquo;ll have the chance to work with you. Please don&rsquo;t hesitate to contact our coordinators at <a href="mailto:{{ site.email }}">{{ site.email }}</a> with any questions or concerns,</p>
