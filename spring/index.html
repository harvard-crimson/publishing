            <h2>About the Conference</h2>
            <p>The innovation conference is a one-day event for high school journalists with all levels of experience. Participants will attend seminars on different aspects of journalism led by our editors and executives, panels on how to incorporate journalism experiences into college applications, as well as attend a keynote speech by an accomplished journalist followed by a Q&amp;A session. Faculty advisors will also have a chance to tour the building and participate in a roundtable discussion. The conference provides participants with the opportunity to learn from and interact with experienced college journalists in a fun, collegiate setting. By working with our editors as well as fellow attendees, all participants will improve their skills and strengthen their interest in journalism, coming up with new ideas that they can then implement in their own papers. We look forward to meeting you on March 31!</p>

            <p>Central to our spring conference is innovation in journalism; our seminar offerings, in addition to teaching techniques on how to improve journalistic skills, will focus on how to stay ahead in this rapidly changing field and how to advance newspaper organizations as a whole. Examples of innovation in high-school journalism covered by our seminars include online-only content, long-form journalism, harnessing social media, producing videos, online strategy, blogs, and alternative revenue streams beyond print advertising. This conference is designed to complement our fall conference, held in October, which emphasizes the fundamentals and intricacies of traditional reporting.</p>
