        <h2>About the Spring Journalism Conference</h2>
        <p>The spring conference focuses on feedback and improving the quality of work that students produce during the school year. While the main purpose of the fall conference is instructive, the spring conference is an opportunity for editors and staff to hear input, reflect on their work over the past year, and share their accomplishments with peers from all over the New England area.</p>
        <p>The conference is a one-day event for high school journalists with all levels of experience. Participants will receive individual feedback from Crimson editors on work they choose to submit, attend seminars on different aspects of journalism led by our editors and executives, as well as a keynote speech by an accomplished journalist followed by a Q&A session. Faculty advisors will also have a chance to tour the building and participate in a roundtable discussion. Awards will be presented to editors, staff, and schools that have demonstrated journalistic excellence.</p>
        <p>The conference provides participants with the opportunity to learn from and interact with experienced college journalists in a fun, collegiate setting. By working with our editors as well as fellow attendees, all participants will improve their skills and strengthen their interest in journalism, coming up with new ideas that they can then implement in their own papers. The timing of the conference at the end of the school year offers a sense of closure, an opportunity for editors and staff to celebrate a year of hard work, and a time to prepare for their upcoming semesters.</p>
